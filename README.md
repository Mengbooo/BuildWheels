是不是这么翻译呢，似乎并不是，正确的“造轮子”这个词就是先有英文然后直接被翻译过来的。可参考维基百科比较详细的解释。Additionally, those new to a language (and especially those new to programming) will often attempt to manually write many functions for which a more robust and optimized equivalent already exists in the standard library or other easily available libraries.
